            Originally, sushi was fermented fish with rice preserved in salt,
            and this was a staple dish in Japan for a thousand years until 
            the Edo Period (1603 to 1868) when contemporary sushi was developed. 
            The word “sushi” means “it's sour,” which reflects back to sushi's 
            origins of being preserved in salt.
