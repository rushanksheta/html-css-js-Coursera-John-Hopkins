          The definition of chicken is a domestic bird 
          used for meat and laying eggs, the meat that 
          comes from such a bird, or is a slang term for 
          someone who is fearful or cowardly. 
          A bird that lives in a barn and lays eggs is an example of a chicken.

          Originally, sushi was fermented fish with rice preserved in salt,
          and this was a staple dish in Japan for a thousand years until 
          the Edo Period (1603 to 1868) when contemporary sushi was developed. 
          The word “sushi” means “it's sour,” which reflects back to sushi's 
          origins of being preserved in salt.
